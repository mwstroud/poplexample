# poplexample

This code has a .g4 grammar file, a .py file to run the antlr generated Parser and Lexer, and an inp.txt file containing the code to be parsed.

This is just to make sure your environment is set up correctly to run antlr4 and has the correct python runtime environment.
This is also a skeleton to start working on your own parser.
